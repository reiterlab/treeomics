### What is Treeomics?
Treeomics is a computational tool to reconstruct the phylogeny of metastases with commonly available sequencing technologies.
The tool detects putative artifacts in noisy sequencing data and infers robust evolutionary trees across a variety of evaluated scenarios.
For more details, see our publication *Reconstructing metastatic seeding patterns of human cancers* (Nature Communications, 8, 14114, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14114](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14114)).

    In the new version 12.7.1 apparently Python 3.4 is no longer officially supported, however, cplex seems to work nicely after updating two files and changing the version check from ```(3, 5, 0)``` to ```(3, 4, 0)``` in both the ```setup.py``` (in MacOS here: ```Applications/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1271/cplex/python/3.5/x86-64_osx/```) to install cplex in Python 3.4 as well as in your miniconda installation ```miniconda3/lib/python3.4/site-packages/cplex/_internal/_pycplex_platform.py```. You will see where an exception is thrown if you test your installation with ```python3 -c 'import cplex'```.
    You may also need to add cplex to your ```PYTHONPATH``` with: ```export PYTHONPATH="~/Applications/IBM/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1271/cplex/python/3.5/x86-64_osx/:$PYTHONPATH"```

3. Install optional packages:

### <a name="getting"> Getting started with Treeomics
1. Input files: The input to ```__main__.py``` is either
  - two tab-delimited text files -- one for variant read data and one for coverage data. Please see the files ```input/Makohon2017/Pam03_mutant_reads.txt``` and ```input/Makohon2017/Pam03_phredcoverage.txt``` included in this repository for examples.
  - VCF-files of all samples
2. Go into the new folder with ```cd treeomics/src```
3. Type the following command to run the simulation: ```python treeomics -r <mut-reads table> -s <coverage table> -o``` 
where ```<mut-reads table>``` is the path to a tab-separated-value file with the number of 
reads reporting a variant (row) in each sample (column) and ```<coverage table>``` is the path to a tab-separated-value 
file with the sequencing depth at the position of this variant in each sample.

##### Usage: 
```shell
$ python treeomics -r <mut-reads table> -s <coverage table> | -v <vcf file> | -d <vcf file directory> -o
```

##### Optional parameters:
- *-e <sequencing error rate>:* Sequencing error rate *e* in the Bayesian inference model (default 1.0%)
- *-a <max absent VAF>:* Maximum VAF for an absent variant *f<sub>absent</sub>* before considering the estimated purity (default 5%)

- *-o <output directory>:* Provide different output directory (default src/output)
- *-n <normal sample names>:* If a normal sample is provided, variants significantly present in the normal are removed. Additional normal samples can be provided via a space-separated enumeration. E.g. ```-n FIRSTNORMALSAMPLE SECONDNORMALSAMPLE ```
- *-x <samples to exclude>:* Space-separated enumeration of sample names to exclude from the analysis. E.g. ```-x FIRSTEXCLUDEDSAMPLE SECONDEXCLUDEDSAMPLE ```
- ```--pool_size``` *<Pool size of ILP solver>:* Number of best solutions explored by ILP solver to assess the support of the inferred branches (default 1000)
- *-b <No bootstrapping samples>:* Number of bootstrapping samples (default 0); Generally using the solution pool instead of bootstrapping seems to be the more efficient way to assess confidence.
- *-u:* Enables subclone detection (default ```False```)
<!--- - ```--no_subclone_detection``` Disables subclone detection) -->
- *-c <min median coverage>:* Minimum median coverage of a sample to be considered (default 0)

- *-l <max no MPS>:* Maximum number of considered mutation patterns per variant (default ```None```). If not ```None```, the obtained solution is no longer guaranteed to be optimal
- ```--driver_genes=<path to file>``` Path to CSV file with names of putative driver genes highlighted in inferred phylogeny (default ```--driver_genes=../input/Tokheim_drivers_union.csv```)
- ```--wes_filtering``` Removes intronic and intergenic variants in WES data (default ```False```)
- ```--common_vars_file``` Path to file with common variants in normal samples and therefore removed from analysis (default ```None```)
- ```--no_plots``` Disables generation of X11 depending plots (useful for benchmarking; default plots are generated ```plots```)
- ```--no_tikztrees``` Disables generation of latex trees which do not depend on X11 (default latex trees are generated ```tikztrees```)
- ```--benchmarking``` Generates mutation matrix and mutation pattern files that can be used for automatic benchmarking of silico data (default ```False```)
- ```--include``` Provide a list of sample names that should be analyzed (e.g., ```--include PT1 PT2 PT3 PT4```)

Default parameter values as well as output directory can be changed in ```treeomics/src/treeomics/settings.py```.
Moreover, the ```settings.py``` provides more options an annotation of driver genes and configuration of plot output names. 
All plots, analysis and logging files, and the HTML report will be in this output directory.

##### Optional input:
- *Driver gene annotation:* Treeomics highlights any non-synonymous or splice-site variants (if VarCode is available, otherwise all) in putative driver genes given in a CSV-file under ```DRIVER_PATH``` in ```treeomics/src/treeomics/settings.py```. As default list, the union of reported driver genes by 20/20+, TUSON, and MutsigCV from Tokheim et al. (PNAS, 2016) is used (see ```treeomics/src/input/Tokheim_drivers_union.csv```). Any CSV-file can be used as long as there is column named 'Gene_Symbol'. Variants in these provided genes will be highlighted in the HTML report as well as in the inferred phylogeny.
- *Cancer Gene Census (CGC) annotation:* Variants that have been identified as likely drivers in the provided genes (under ```DRIVER_PATH```) will be check if they occurred in the reported region in the given CSV-file (default ```treeomics/src/input/cancer_gene_census_grch37_v80.csv```; CGC version 80, reference genome hg19).
